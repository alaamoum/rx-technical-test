See types.ts to learn the structure of the Video Manifest

The manifest is queryable at `http://localhost:5000/videos/BigBuckBunny2Sec/bbb-2sec.json`

And the root for every other segments is `http://localhost:5000/videos/BigBuckBunny2Sec/ `
`

You can start the content server by `npm run start` in prod mode or `npm run start:dev` in dev mode (hot reloading)
